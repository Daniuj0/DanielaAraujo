- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daniuj0
- 👀 I’m interested in small projects to test for free, as my focus is on learning and improving my learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming logic, javascript and watson assitant
- ✅ I’m looking to collaborate on q.a test for while
- 📫 How to reach me 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like testing because I am thorough and focus on the user experience as if I was the user.
